# TextWrapper
A console application that reads text from file (input.txt) and wraps text based on a maximum number of character parameter provided for wrapping lines of text. To make this exciting for reviewers, I provisioned options (A, B, C) to allow the reviewer to optionally select what task to run. I also created an option to allow users dynamically create an input file. The program is meant to read input text from file. So this helps make the console application a bit engaging. When running option B, which reads and wraps text in input file, the wrapped text is saved to an output file (output.txt). To exit the application, the reviewer can select option C to quit.
