# TextWrapper
A console application that reads text from file (input.txt) and wraps text based on a parameter that specifies the number of characters for each line of text. To make this a little exciting for reviewers, I provisioned options (A, B, C) to allow the reviewer to select what task to run. I also created an option to allow users dynamically create an input file. The program is meant to read input text from file. So this helps make the console application a little bit engaging. When running option B, which reads and wraps text in input file, the wrapped text is saved to an output file (output.txt) and displayed on the console. To exit the application, the reviewer can select option C to quit.
